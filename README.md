## About
Effectify is a small extension for Spotify that allows users to change playback speed and add effects to the music. Because it uses Spicetify, we need to have a installation utility which does an automatic execution of certain PowerShell commands. 

## Contribution
We appreciate any contribution, and you can do so by opening a pull-request with your changes.

## Installation

- Clone github repository
